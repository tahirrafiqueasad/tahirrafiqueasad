**Hi, I am Tahir Rafique**

I am a AI Developer from Pakistan.

I am interested in:
- Python
- Django
- PyQt
- Machine Learning
- Data Science

Most of the time I am working on pipeline that involve Machine learning and Django apis. I make apis that receive request from user and process it through machine learning algorthms (eg, detection, segmentation etc) and send result back to user.

I am looking farward to work on NLP and Reinforcement Learning.
